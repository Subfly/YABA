    <string name="how_to_keyboard_general_message_1">YABA includes a custom keyboard, giving you quick access to your saved content without leaving your current app—for example, your browser or a messaging app. Setting it up is a simple two-step process. Start with navigating to settings and finding the **Enable YABA Keyboard** option.</string>
    <string name="how_to_keyboard_general_message_10">If everything went smoothly, YABA Keyboard is now ready to use. When your main keyboard is visible, tap the **Globe** icon at the bottom left to switch keyboards. You can also tap and hold the icon to see all your keyboards in a pop-up. If YABA Keyboard appears here, the setup is complete.</string>
    <string name="how_to_keyboard_general_message_11">Once YABA Keyboard is open, you’ll see a familiar interface. You can easily browse your folders and tags to access your bookmarks.</string>
    <string name="how_to_keyboard_general_message_12">Tapping a bookmark automatically inserts its link into the currently focused text box. Use the buttons in the top-right corner to delete the link or confirm the paste. Depending on the app, confirming may trigger a search, send a message, or perform another action.</string>
    <string name="how_to_keyboard_general_message_2">After tapping **Enable YABA Keyboard**, you’ll be taken to YABA’s settings on your device. Here you can also change the app’s language or enable/disable local network access. To continue setup, tap **Keyboards**.</string>
    <string name="how_to_keyboard_general_message_3">You’ll see two options here. To see YABA as a keyboard in a later step, make sure to enable both.</string>
    <string name="how_to_keyboard_general_message_4">When enabling the second option, a system pop-up will appear. Don’t worry—YABA will never collect your data or send anything to a remote server, as promised during onboarding. To use YABA as a keyboard, tap **Allow**. You can always review the open-source codebase to see exactly how YABA Keyboard works and confirm that no data is ever collected.</string>
    <string name="how_to_keyboard_general_message_5">Now you’re ready for the second step. Go back to your device settings, find the **General** tab, and tap it.</string>
    <string name="how_to_keyboard_general_message_6">In there, you have to find “Keyboard” and tap it.</string>
    <string name="how_to_keyboard_general_message_7">When you reach **Keyboards**, you’ll see your existing keyboards. If YABA is already listed, you’re all set. If not, tap **Add New Keyboard**.</string>
    <string name="how_to_keyboard_general_message_8">In the pop-up, look under **Third-Party Keyboards**. YABA should appear here if you enabled both options in the previous step. Don’t worry if you don’t see it right away—just make sure both options are enabled.</string>
    <string name="how_to_keyboard_general_message_9">Once YABA is added, you can use the Edit button to change its order among your keyboards.</string>
    <string name="how_to_keyboard_title">Keyboard</string>
    <string name="how_to_reminders_general_message_1">Setting up reminders in YABA is simple. In the bookmark details, you’ll find several options—on Mac they’re shown directly, while on iOS/iPad you can tap the three dots icon for more. On all devices, tap the yellow **bell** icon to create a reminder.</string>
    <string name="how_to_reminders_general_message_2">After tapping, a pop-up will appear where you can select a time for your reminder. Tap Done to save it.</string>
    <string name="how_to_reminders_general_message_3">YABA only asks for permissions when they’re truly needed. The first time you set up a reminder, you’ll see a prompt asking for notification access. Simply tap **Allow** to let YABA send your reminder notifications. Don’t worry—YABA will never send notifications for anything else.</string>
    <string name="how_to_reminders_general_message_4">Once set up, you’ll see a confirmation of your reminder, and the scheduled time will appear as the last item in the bookmark’s info section.</string>
    <string name="how_to_reminders_general_message_5">You can cancel a reminder anytime by swiping its tile. When you tap **Delete**, a confirmation pop-up will appear to prevent accidental cancellations.</string>
    <string name="how_to_reminders_general_message_6">When your reminder triggers, YABA will notify you to return to your bookmark—sometimes with a funny message to keep things light. 😉</string>
    <string name="how_to_reminders_title">Reminders</string>
    <string name="how_to_share_general_message_1">When sharing content, you’ll see the YABA icon in the share pop-up. YABA works with almost any app, and if the shared content includes a link, it will automatically open YABA’s bookmark creation view.</string>
    <string name="how_to_share_general_message_2">The first time you use sharing, YABA may not appear in the share pop-up. Simply swipe to the end of the app list and tap the **three dots icon** to manage and enable YABA.</string>
    <string name="how_to_share_general_message_3">After tapping the three dots icon, you’ll see a list of available apps. Simply add YABA by tapping the green plus button next to it.</string>
    <string name="how_to_share_general_message_4">Once added, you can reorder the apps using the sliders on the right. Feel free to move YABA to the top for quicker access. 😉</string>
    <string name="how_to_share_general_message_5">Once YABA is added to your shareable apps, it will always appear as an option when sharing links. Selecting YABA opens a pop-up to save your bookmark. YABA will automatically fetch details like the image, title, and description, but we recommend writing your own title and description for easier recall and search later. In this pop-up, you can also choose a folder for your bookmark (if none is selected, it will be saved under **Uncategorized**) and add tags for better organization. You can even create new folders and tags on the spot.</string>
    <string name="how_to_share_general_message_6">If you prefer a quicker flow, you can enable **Simple Share Sheet** mode in Settings to streamline the process.</string>
    <string name="how_to_share_general_message_7">Once enabled, you’ll experience a simpler flow. The process works the same in the background—YABA will still fetch content automatically. All you need to do is set a title for your bookmark (recommended for easier search, even though it’s auto-filled). \n\nBookmarks saved through Simple Share Sheet are placed in the Uncategorized folder without tags. In future updates, AI-powered features (still free) are planned to make this smoother, but for now you’ll need to organize these bookmarks manually in the app.</string>
    <string name="how_to_share_general_message_8">Some apps may hide the native share sheet since they offer their own bookmarking features. But YABA is usually a better option 😎, so you might need to navigate a bit to find it. For example, in the Reddit app, tapping Share brings up a menu where you’ll need to tap the three dots icon to access YABA.</string>
    <string name="how_to_share_general_message_9">Sometimes the native share sheet is nested deeper. For example, in the Reddit app, tapping the three dots opens a custom share sheet, and you may need to tap the three dots again to reach the native share sheet. It’s not the most convenient, but if you don’t see YABA, just keep tapping the three dots until it appears. 😉</string>
    <string name="how_to_share_mac_message_1">Quickly add bookmarks to YABA with **⌘⇧Y (Command + Shift + Y)**. A window will pop up for you to paste your link. YABA will fetch the title automatically within seconds, but we recommend writing your own title to make finding it later even easier.</string>
    <string name="how_to_share_mac_message_2">To use the quick key **(⌘⇧Y)** and open the quick share/save pop-up, the menu bar item must be running. The menu bar item also makes it easy to browse your recently saved bookmarks or open the quick share/save pop-up with a single click.</string>
    <string name="how_to_share_mac_message_3">You can enable or disable the menu bar item anytime in Settings.</string>
    <string name="how_to_share_title">Share</string>
    <string name="how_to_step_label_lld">Step %1$d</string>
    <string name="how_to_sync_general_message_1">Syncing is a core feature of YABA—and a big reason it stays free. YABA doesn’t rely on servers, so your data is never stored elsewhere—you have full ownership at all times. Because YABA supports devices beyond the Apple ecosystem, we needed a cost-free solution that still keeps your data fully yours. The result is a local, multicast-based synchronization system. Think of it like exporting your content, emailing it to yourself, and importing it on another device—but fully automated for you. 😉 To start syncing, your device needs a name. This is usually set after onboarding or when you relaunch YABA, but you can change it anytime in Settings.</string>
    <string name="how_to_sync_general_message_2">On all devices, Sync is easy to access—at the top left of your Home Screen on mobile, or in the sidebar on tablets and computers. Once opened, a local server will automatically search for and detect your devices on the current network.</string>
    <string name="how_to_sync_general_message_3">The first time you use Sync, YABA will ask for permission to access the Local Network. This must be enabled for Sync to work. If you deny it, you’ll need to manually enable Local Network access for YABA in your device’s Settings, as YABA is not allowed to request it again.</string>
    <string name="how_to_sync_general_message_4">Once allowed, you’ll see a screen with instructions and a list of devices on your network. To make your other devices visible, ensure they’re connected to the same network and have the Sync screen open. An active internet connection isn’t required—connecting through the same hotspot is enough for YABA to discover your devices.</string>
    <string name="how_to_sync_general_message_5">When your devices are on the same network and the Sync screen is open, they’ll appear in the list of **Available Devices**.</string>
    <string name="how_to_sync_general_message_6">When you select a device, it will receive a sync request. This step ensures you don’t accidentally connect to other devices on the same network, protecting you from unwanted access. Once the request is accepted, synchronization begins automatically.</string>
    <string name="how_to_sync_general_message_7">When syncing is complete, a toast message will confirm that it was successful.</string>
    <string name="how_to_sync_general_message_8">In Settings, you’ll find the option **Sync Without Deletes**, which changes how syncing behaves across your devices. Since sync happens between two devices at a time, let’s call them Device A and Device B:\"\n\n**Both devices: option disabled** →\n\n- All deletions are synced. Both devices end up with the same content (including removed items).\n\n**Both devices: option enabled** →\n\n- Deletions are skipped. Each device transfers its data to the other, so deleted items reappear.\nUseful for recovering from accidental deletes or transferring content without losses.\n\n**Device A enabled, Device B disabled** →\n\n- Device A skips deletions from B but accepts all of B’s content.\n\n- Device B processes deletions from A normally.\nUseful if you want one device to act as a full archive while another stays more curated.\n\nYou can experiment with these settings to find the setup that works best for you.</string>

    <string name="how_to_tip_label_lld">Tip %1$d</string>
    <string name="how_to_tips_message_1">Almost everything in YABA is interactive—you can swipe on many items to reveal additional options.</string>
    <string name="how_to_tips_message_2">You can also tap and hold (or use a two-finger tap for Mac) on any item to open a pop-up menu with the same options as swiping.</string>
    <string name="how_to_tips_message_3">You can delete announcements by swiping, using a two-finger tap on Mac, or tapping the trash icon. Don’t worry—you can always view past announcements in Settings.</string>
    <string name="how_to_tips_message_4">You can add a quick launcher for YABA to your Control Center on all devices, and even place it on the lock screen of your iPhone or iPad.</string>
    <string name="how_to_tips_message_5">On Mac and iPad, you can easily resize panes by dragging their edges. This works for both the sidebar and the content/detail dividers.</string>
    <string name="how_to_tips_title">Tips &amp; Tricks</string>
    <string name="how_to_widgets_general_message_1">YABA widgets make it easy to quickly open your favorite content from folders or tags, or to view your most recently saved bookmarks. Adding a widget is simple—just press and hold anywhere on your home screen until the icons start jiggling.</string>
    <string name="how_to_widgets_general_message_2">When the icons begin to jiggle, the next step depends on your iOS version. On iOS 26, tap **Edit** in the top-left corner and select **Add Widget** from the pop-up. On iOS 18, tap the **+** button in the top-left corner, rest is the same.</string>
    <string name="how_to_widgets_general_message_3">After tapping, a pop-up will appear showing all available widgets. Search for **YABA** to see its options. You’ll find two types of widgets: **Collection Widgets**, available in two sizes, which let you quickly open a favorite folder or tag from your Home Screen; and the **Bookmark Widget**, which shows the most recently saved bookmarks from a chosen folder or tag.</string>
    <string name="how_to_widgets_general_message_4">Once a widget is added, press and hold on it to open a pop-up, then select **Edit Widget** to customize it.</string>
    <string name="how_to_widgets_general_message_5">All YABA widgets include the option to select a folder or tag. When you tap this setting, you’ll see your folders and tags listed in order—just choose the one you want to link to the widget.</string>
    <string name="how_to_widgets_general_message_6">Finally, there’s an extra option called **Recents**, which shows the five most recently saved bookmarks across all of your folders. This gives you a quick glance at your latest saves and an easy way to jump back to them.</string>
    <string name="how_to_widgets_mac_message_1">YABA widgets make it easy to quickly open your favorite content from folders or tags, or to view your most recently saved bookmarks.
